## RNN By Aman Mehta 
Python code file demonstrating the implementation of a basic Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for sequence classification using TensorFlow and Keras. This code provides an explanation for each step of the RNN implementation.

```python
# Importing necessary libraries
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Define the RNN model architecture
model = models.Sequential([
    # SimpleRNN layer with 64 units and tanh activation function,
    # return_sequences=True to return the full sequence instead of just the output of the last time step,
    # and input_shape=(None, 100) for sequences of variable length with 100 features each
    layers.SimpleRNN(64, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(None, 100)),
    
    # Another SimpleRNN layer with 64 units and tanh activation function
    layers.SimpleRNN(64),
    
    # Dense layer with 10 units and softmax activation function for classification
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Display model architecture summary
model.summary()

# Load and preprocess the data (replace with your own dataset and preprocessing steps)
# Example: sequences, labels = preprocess_data()

# Train the model
# Example: model.fit(sequences, labels, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.1)

# Evaluate the model on test data
# Example: test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_sequences, test_labels)
# print('Test accuracy:', test_acc)
```

Explanation:
- The code starts by importing the necessary libraries, including TensorFlow and Keras.
- The RNN model architecture is defined using the `Sequential` API, consisting of SimpleRNN layers and a Dense layer.
- The first SimpleRNN layer is configured with 64 units, a tanh activation function, and `return_sequences=True` to return the full sequence.
- Another SimpleRNN layer follows with 64 units and a tanh activation function.
- Finally, a Dense layer with 10 units and a softmax activation function is added for classification.
- The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer, sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function, and accuracy metric.
- The `summary()` method is called to display a summary of the model architecture. However, data preprocessing, training, and evaluation are commented out as placeholders.
- In a real-world scenario, you would replace the placeholder data loading, preprocessing, training, and evaluation steps with your own dataset and corresponding steps.

This code provides a basic implementation of an RNN for sequence classification using TensorFlow and Keras. You can modify and extend this code for your specific dataset and classification task.
