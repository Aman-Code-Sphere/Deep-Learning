## CNN Implementation & Explanation By Aman Mehta 
Explain the implementation of CNN. Python code file demonstrating the implementation of a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. This code provides an explanation for each step of the CNN implementation.

```python
# Importing necessary libraries
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Define the CNN model architecture
model = models.Sequential([
    # Convolutional layer with 32 filters, each with a 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation function,
    # and input shape of (28, 28, 1) for grayscale images (MNIST dataset)
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    
    # Max pooling layer with a 2x2 pool size for downsampling
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    
    # Convolutional layer with 64 filters and a 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation function
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    
    # Max pooling layer with a 2x2 pool size for downsampling
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    
    # Convolutional layer with 64 filters and a 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation function
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    
    # Flatten layer to convert 3D feature maps into 1D feature vectors
    layers.Flatten(),
    
    # Fully connected dense layer with 64 units and ReLU activation function
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    
    # Output layer with 10 units (for 10 classes in the MNIST dataset) and softmax activation function
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Display model architecture summary
model.summary()

# Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset
mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = mnist.load_data()
train_images = train_images.reshape((60000, 28, 28, 1)) / 255.0
test_images = test_images.reshape((10000, 28, 28, 1)) / 255.0

# Train the model
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=5, batch_size=64, validation_split=0.1)

# Evaluate the model on test data
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)
print('Test accuracy:', test_acc)
```

Explanation:
- The code starts by importing the necessary libraries, including TensorFlow and Keras.
- The CNN model architecture is defined using the `Sequential` API, consisting of convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and dense layers.
- Each layer is added sequentially, starting with a convolutional layer, followed by max-pooling, additional convolutional layers, flattening, and fully connected dense layers.
- The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer, sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function, and accuracy metric.
- The `summary()` method is called to display a summary of the model architecture.
- The MNIST dataset is loaded and preprocessed. The images are reshaped to have a single channel (grayscale) and normalized to the range [0, 1].
- The model is trained using the `fit()` method on the training data for a specified number of epochs and batch size, with a validation split of 10%.
- Finally, the model is evaluated on the test data using the `evaluate()` method, and the test accuracy is printed.

This code provides a basic implementation of a CNN for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. You can modify and extend this code for your specific dataset and classification task.
