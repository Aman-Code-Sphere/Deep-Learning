### [Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) By Aman Mehta](https://github.com/AmanMehta199816/Aman-Mehta-Deep-Learning-/blob/main/CNN%20Implementation%20By%20Aman.md) 
![MC6eSuC3yypCU](https://github.com/AmanMehta199816/Aman-Mehta-Deep-Learning-/assets/96304523/098086b6-2b5b-42a4-b200-d06b178117ea)

#### Overview
[Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)](https://github.com/AmanMehta199816/Aman-Mehta-Deep-Learning-/blob/main/CNN%20Implementation%20By%20Aman.md) are a class of deep neural networks commonly used for image recognition, classification, and segmentation tasks. They are inspired by the organization of the animal visual cortex, allowing them to efficiently capture spatial hierarchies of features.

#### Key Components
1. **Convolutional Layers**: These layers apply convolution operations to input images, extracting local features through filters or kernels.
2. **Pooling Layers**: Pooling layers downsample feature maps, reducing computational complexity and providing translation invariance.
3. **Activation Functions**: Common activation functions include ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), which introduces non-linearity into the network.
4. **Fully Connected Layers**: Fully connected layers perform classification based on the features extracted by convolutional layers.

#### Training Process
1. **Forward Pass**: Input images are passed through the network, and feature maps are generated by convolutional and pooling layers.
2. **Loss Computation**: A loss function, such as cross-entropy loss, compares the predicted output with the ground truth labels.
3. **Backpropagation**: Gradients are computed with respect to the loss, and the network parameters are updated using optimization algorithms like SGD or Adam.

#### Applications
1. **Image Classification**: [CNNs](https://github.com/AmanMehta199816/Aman-Mehta-Deep-Learning-/blob/main/CNN%20Implementation%20By%20Aman.md) excel at classifying images into predefined categories, such as identifying objects in photographs.
2. **Object Detection**: [CNNs](https://github.com/AmanMehta199816/Aman-Mehta-Deep-Learning-/blob/main/CNN%20Implementation%20By%20Aman.md) can be used for detecting and localizing objects within images, often in conjunction with techniques like region proposal networks.
3. **Semantic Segmentation**: [CNNs](https://github.com/AmanMehta199816/Aman-Mehta-Deep-Learning-/blob/main/CNN%20Implementation%20By%20Aman.md) can assign semantic labels to each pixel in an image, enabling tasks like image segmentation and scene understanding.
4. **Face Recognition**: [CNNs](https://github.com/AmanMehta199816/Aman-Mehta-Deep-Learning-/blob/main/CNN%20Implementation%20By%20Aman.md) have been successful in recognizing faces and performing facial attribute analysis in applications like security and biometrics.

#### Best Practices
1. **Transfer Learning**: Leveraging pre-trained [CNN](https://github.com/AmanMehta199816/Aman-Mehta-Deep-Learning-/blob/main/CNN%20Implementation%20By%20Aman.md) models and fine-tuning them on specific tasks can significantly reduce training time and improve performance.
2. **Data Augmentation**: Augmenting training data with transformations like rotation, flipping, and cropping helps prevent overfitting and improves generalization.
3. **Regularization**: Techniques like dropout and weight decay can be used to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization ability of [CNNs](https://github.com/AmanMehta199816/Aman-Mehta-Deep-Learning-/blob/main/CNN%20Implementation%20By%20Aman.md).
4. **Model Evaluation**: Use appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the performance of CNN models on validation and test datasets.

### [Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) By Aman Mehta](https://github.com/AmanMehta199816/Aman-Mehta-Deep-Learning-/blob/main/RNN%20By%20Aman%20Mehta.md)
![JTJ3gel6umqORZTNMI](https://github.com/AmanMehta199816/Aman-Mehta-Deep-Learning-/assets/96304523/f9db7d7c-011c-4d7d-9f1c-c84e7cb84d82)


#### Overview
[Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)](https://github.com/AmanMehta199816/Aman-Mehta-Deep-Learning-/blob/main/RNN%20By%20Aman%20Mehta.md) are a class of neural networks designed to handle sequential data by maintaining state information across time steps. They have loops within their architecture, allowing them to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior and process sequences of varying lengths.

#### Key Components
1. **Recurrent Connections**: [RNNs](https://github.com/AmanMehta199816/Aman-Mehta-Deep-Learning-/blob/main/RNN%20By%20Aman%20Mehta.md) have recurrent connections that allow information to persist over time and be passed from one time step to the next.
2. **Hidden State**: At each time step, the network maintains a hidden state that encapsulates information about the sequence seen so far.
3. **Activation Functions**: Common activation functions like tanh or ReLU are used to introduce non-linearity into the network.
4. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: An extension of RNNs, LSTMs incorporate memory cells and gating mechanisms to better capture long-range dependencies and mitigate vanishing gradient problems.

#### Training Process
1. **Forward Pass**: Input sequences are fed into the network one time step at a time, and the hidden states are updated recursively.
2. **Loss Computation**: A loss function, often cross-entropy or mean squared error, is used to measure the difference between predicted and true values.
3. **Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)**: Gradients are computed with respect to the loss across all time steps, and the network parameters are updated using optimization algorithms like SGD or Adam.

#### Applications
1. **Sequence Prediction**: [RNNs](https://github.com/AmanMehta199816/Aman-Mehta-Deep-Learning-/blob/main/RNN%20By%20Aman%20Mehta.md) can predict the next element in a sequence, making them useful for tasks like language modeling, time series forecasting, and music generation.
2. **Sequence Classification**: [RNNs](https://github.com/AmanMehta199816/Aman-Mehta-Deep-Learning-/blob/main/RNN%20By%20Aman%20Mehta.md) can classify entire sequences, such as sentiment analysis of text or activity recognition in videos.
3. **Sequence Generation**: [RNNs](https://github.com/AmanMehta199816/Aman-Mehta-Deep-Learning-/blob/main/RNN%20By%20Aman%20Mehta.md) can generate new sequences by sampling from learned distributions, enabling applications like text generation and image captioning.
4. **Language Translation**: [RNNs](https://github.com/AmanMehta199816/Aman-Mehta-Deep-Learning-/blob/main/RNN%20By%20Aman%20Mehta.md), particularly with attention mechanisms, are used in machine translation systems to translate text between different languages.

#### Best Practices
1. **Gradient Clipping**: To mitigate exploding gradient problems, gradient clipping can be applied to limit the magnitude of gradients during training.
2. **Vanishing Gradient Problem**: Techniques like LSTM and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) address the vanishing gradient problem by introducing memory cells and gating mechanisms.
3. **Teacher Forcing**: During training, instead of using the model's own predictions as inputs for subsequent time steps, teacher forcing uses ground truth values, improving convergence and stability.
4. **Bidirectional RNNs**: Bidirectional RNNs process sequences in both forward and backward directions, allowing them to capture dependencies from past and future contexts.

              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(train_sequences, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(val_sequences, val_labels))
